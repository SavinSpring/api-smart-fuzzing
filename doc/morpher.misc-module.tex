\section{Package morpher.misc}

    \label{morpher:misc}
Contains various modules that are shared by more than one package or do not
fall neatly into the scope of other packages.

Currently contains \texttt{config}, a class used to share configuration 
information between all components of a project; \texttt{log\_setup}, which
contains a simple method that initializes the project-wide logging system; 
\texttt{status\_reporter}, which contains a class for tracking and 
displaying progress in the form of a status bar; and 
\texttt{section\_parameter}, which builds off of \texttt{status\_reporter} 
to report the progress of a multi-part program.
