
-----Week 1-------

[E][X] Set up Subversion repository
[E][ ] Install development environments for team members
[ ][ ] Find a simple, standalone DLL with an accompanying header file
       with a small number of functions, so we can write a simple 
       client program for it in C and link against it for further 
       testing as well as use the header file for parser tests

Collector Phase 1
[P][X] Find a simple DLL for testing (shell32.dll)
[R][X] Find a tool that prints exported functions, addresses for DLL
[R][ ] Execute above tool on a named file from a test Python script
[R][ ] Successfully hook/set brkpts in a custom C program from Python
[R][ ] Successfully hook/set brkpts in a DLL from Python
[R][ ] Write a script that finds all exported functions for a DLL by 
       calling the tool we found and parsing the result file
[R][ ] Have the above script set breakpoints for all of the functions
[R][ ] Have above script then set client program running and write to
       a log every time a breakpoint is reached
    
Parser Phase 1
[P][ ] Come up with a method for parsing functions from DLL C header
[P][ ] Write code to extract function definitions from a .h file
[P][ ] Successfully test on a simple header file
